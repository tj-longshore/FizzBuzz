# FizzBuzz

A site for the classic FizzBuzz problem. The user can enter the range of values they would like displayed. They can also enter in custom values for "Fizz" and "Buzz". If a number in the range is divisible by values of Fizz or Buzz, "Fizz" or "Buzz" will be displayed rather than the respective number. If a number is divisible by both values it will display "FizzBuzz" instead.
